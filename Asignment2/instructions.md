# Assignment 2: Create a Face Annotation Tool
Now that you have learnt how to use mouse for annotation with OpenCV, it's time to put your concepts to a test. In this assignment, you will create a GUI application which will let the user create a bounding box around a face present in the input image and save the cropped face automatically.

We have given below a video demo of the expected output.

## Grading
The assignment carries 30 marks and will be graded manually by staff members. Make sure that you submit a working code as you will not be awarded any marks if your code doesn't work.

Note that only 1 submission will be allowed so make sure that you test your code properly before submitting.

## What to submit?
Please submit the following files in zip format:

1. A working C++ code - submission.cpp

2. All the required data files.

3. CMakeLists.txt file

4. Any other necessary file.

While grading, we will just unzip your submission and run your code. So make sure that you have submitted all the files required.
